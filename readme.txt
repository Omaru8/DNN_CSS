1. Utilize Google Colab for executing the code by accessing the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Import the IPython notebooks into the appropriate environment.
3. Generate the training data by executing the "DataTrain" and "DataTrain_paper" notebooks.
4. Create the test data by utilizing the "DataTest" and "DataTest_paper" notebooks.
5. Train the models by executing the code within the "Training.ipynb" notebook.
6. Test the models, obtain the ROC_curve, and calculate Pd_SNR by executing the code in the "Testing.ipynb" notebook.

In order to evaluate the pre-trained models stored in the "trained_models" folder, you can simply load the ".h5" files by running the Python notebook named "Testing.ipynb" and utilizing the available test data.
